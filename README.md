# SnapEnhance
SnapEnhance is an Xposed mod that enhances your Snapchat experience.<br/><br/>
Please note that this project is currently in development, so bugs and crashes may occur. If you encounter any issues, we encourage you to report them. To do this simply visit our [issues](https://github.com/rhunk/SnapEnhance/issues) page and create an issue, make sure to follow the guidelines.
</div>

## Quick Start
Requirements:
- Rooted using Magisk or KernelSU
- LSPosed installed and fully functional

Although using this in an unrooted enviroment using something like LSPatch should be working fine, it is not recommended to do so, use at your own risk!

1. Install the module APK from either this [Github repo](https://github.com/rhunk/SnapEnhance/releases) or the [LSPosed repo](https://modules.lsposed.org/module/me.rhunk.snapenhance)
2. Turn on the module in LSPosed and make sure Snapchat is in scope
3. Force Stop Snapchat
4. Open the menu by clicking the [Settings Gear Icon](https://i.imgur.com/2grm8li.png)

## Download 
To Download the latest stable release, please visit the [Releases](https://github.com/rhunk/SnapEnhance/releases) page.<br/>
You can also download the latest debug build from the [Actions](https://github.com/rhunk/SnapEnhance/actions) section.<br/>
We no longer offer official LSPatch binaries for obvious reasons. However, you're welcome to patch them yourself, as they should theoretically work without any issues.
